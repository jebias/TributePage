          <p>Kazuto basically beat this game by himself. He single handedly defeated Heathcliff and ended the game. Some say that he cheated by using God Mode, but there is no evidence of foul play.</p>
          <h1 style="font-size:150%">ALfheim Online</h1>
          <p>Okay. I will admit that Kazuto used admin commands while playing, but only used the commands to help his opponent by giving them Excalibur. He needed to make the final fight fair since he started the game with his imported OP broken haxed Sword Art Online character.</p>
          <h1 style="font-size:150%">Gun Gale Online</h1>
          <p>Kazuto basically became a Jedi in this game. He went into a FPS VR game, bought a light saber, and then proceeded to win the biggest tournament in the game.</p>

          <p>I haven't seen the movie yet. No spoilers please.</p>
